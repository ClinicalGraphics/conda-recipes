build:
  entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    - wininst2wheel = wheel.wininst2wheel:main
    - egg2wheel = wheel.egg2wheel:main
    - wheel = wheel.tool:main
    # Can't figure out how to get distutils.commands entry points working
    # - bdist_wheel = wheel.bdist_wheel:bdist_wheel
    #
    # Would create an entry point called wheel that calls wheel.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
